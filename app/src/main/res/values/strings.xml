    <string name="place_holder">Our Prices
We work within the customer’s budget. In this regard, please quote your price via live chat. Alternatively, you can proceed to ‘order now‘ and one of our representatives will send a message requesting you to quote your price after placing the order.  We believe in an inclusive approach which can only be achieved through price taking instead of price making.

Terms of Payments

We operate under ‘Cash with Order’ terms of payment. In this regard, you may choose to make the full payment while placing your order. Alternatively, you can make a partial payment and we shall put your order on progressive delivery. We will submit draft copies of your assignment subsequent to the partial amounts paid for the order.</string>
